    My personal website is the the very one you are looking at now.
    I use it as a portfolio for my projects but I'm planning on adding some
    how to guides for some of the technical skills I've learned. (Especially for
    bazel, bazel desperately needs more guides lol).<br/>
    <br/>
    My personal website is designed using the Angular. I have used a few frameworks
    before including React and Vue, but I feel like Angular is a great middle
    ground between simple, current, and having extensive resources.<br/>
    <br/>
    This is actually the second version of my website. My original website was
    created in pure html/css. I decided to overhaul that though since frameworks
    are life. You can still view the source on the main branch of my github pages repo
    <a href="https://github.com/Logan-Pageler/Logan-Pageler.github.io/tree/main">here.</a>

    The source code for my current website is also available on my <a href="https://github.com/Logan-Pageler/logan-personal-website">github</a>.
